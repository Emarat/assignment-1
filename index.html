            <h3>“The key to success is to focus our conscious mind on things we desire, not the things we fear.”- Brian

            <p>
                The precise truth is that our focus drives everything in our lives.
                It almost solely determines if we’ll experience a high quality of life and accomplish things that are
                meaningful
                to us.
                But then key question comes How to stay focused in this most overwhelming information age. How to stay
                focused,
                when our list of goals and dreams is endless to achieve and more is being added to it on daily basis.

            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>
                A mission statement is a short statement of why an organization exists, what its overall goal is,
                identifying the goal of its operations: what kind of product or service it provides, its primary
                customers or market, and its geographical region of operation.[1][2] It may include a short
                statement of such fundamental matters as the organization's values or philosophies, a business's
                main competitive advantages, or a desired future state—the "vision".[1][3]

                As a Web developer, you want to be able to design Web pages that can effectively display material,
